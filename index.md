title: Music Theory: Open-Learning Centre
---

The **Music Theory: Open-Learning Centre** is intended to become an online learning-centre for secondary school students to:
a) access knowledge about; b) develop understanding of; and c) engage in the creative application of music theory.

This project will unashamedly draw upon the work of other educators and developers who have likewise seen the potential and imperative for open-source applications and resources in education. As we move deeper into the 21st century there is an increasing need for resources to embrace the 4 C's of modern education.

To begin with, this project is a direct fork of "Open Music Theory".
**Open Music Theory** is an open-source, interactive, online "text"book for college-level music theory courses. OMT was built on resources authored by Kris Shaffer, Bryn Hughes, and Brian Moseley. It is edited by Kris Shaffer and Robin Wharton, and is published by [Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing](http://www.hybridpedagogy.org/#publishing). 

Major funding and technological support (including the building of the technology behind the interactive music notation modules found in this text) came from the team at [Trinket](http://www.trinket.io).

The first major edition of OMT was made possible financially by [a crowdfunding campaign](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/page-two/open-interactive-music-theory-textbook-campaign-update/) in the summer of 2014. Many thanks to the donors who supported the project (listed on the [about](about.html) page).
