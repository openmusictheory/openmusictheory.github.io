title: Classical cadence types

A *cadence* is a point of arrival that punctuates the end of a musical unit, such as a phrase, theme, large formal section, or movement. A cadence is at once a harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and formal event, but cadences tend to be grouped according to different ways in which harmony and melody articulate that point of arrival.

## Authentic and half cadences

These unit-ending points of arrival are first grouped into *authentic cadences* and *half cadences*. An authentic cadence occurs when a rhythmic phrase ends with the harmonic progression **V<sup>(7)</sup>–I**. If the progression is in root position (*sol* to *do* in the bass voice) and melody accompanying this harmonic progression arrives on *do*, it is called a *perfect authentic cadence* (**PAC**).

*Imperfect authentic cadences* (**IAC**) lack one or more of the aspects of closure (or finality) in a perfect authentic cadence. If the melody does not end on *do* but the harmonies are in root position, it is called a *root position IAC*. If the harmonies are not in root position it is called an *inverted IAC*. The harmonic progression **viiº</sub>6</sub>–I**, with *ti* to *do* in the melody and *re* to *do* in the bass, is another kind of IAC, sometimes called a "contrapuntal cadence."

Phrases that end on **V** without progressing to **I** are called *half cadences*. These cadences typically contain *re* in the melody, though *ti* and *sol* are also possible points of melodic arrival. The **V** arrival of a half cadence is very often a triad, rather than a seventh chord, and it is always in root position.

Differentiating between *perfect authentic cadences* (PAC), *imperfect authentic cadences* (IAC), and *half cadences* (HC) by ear and with a score is essential both to formal analysis and model composition.

The cadence types above are based on the propulsive drive of the dominant harmony to its tonic. These cadences are the engines of tonality. In addition to the main cadence types above, the following are also encountered. 

A *plagal cadence* is defined by the progression **IV–I**. It frequently comes after a PAC as a way of counterpoising the dominant preparation of a major structural cadence. After attaining the tonic goal of the PAC, a confirming plagal cadence continues the flatward (counterclockwise) harmonic motion on the circle of fifths, overshooting the goal of the tonic by one position and landing on the subdominant.

A *deceptive cadence* is a would-be authentic cadence in which the expected tonic is missing and another chord substitutes for it. Very frequently the deceptive chord is **vi** in major (**VI** in minor). Other possibilities include **IV** or **viiº7/V**. Frequently, the bass voice, and sometimes also the melody, still arrive to *do* as they would have in a perfect authentic cadence. In that case only the inner voices do not behave as they "should," and this increases the sense of "deception."

An *evaded cadence* is defined by the progression **V**–**V</sup>4</sup></sub>2</sub>–I</sub>6</sub>**. As such it actually just a type of inverted IAC, but it behaves much like a deceptive cadence and occurs frequently in actual music, which is why it gets its own terminology.

## Simple, compound, and double cadences

Writers of Italian keyboard treatises like [Furno][Furno] and [Fenaroli][Fenaroli] (and, more recently, American historical theorists like [Robert O. Gjerdingen][Gjerdingen]) differentiate cadences according to the voice-leading found over the dominant harmony. These distinctions do not replace the above PAC/IAC/HC distinctions; rather they add another level of detail that is particularly helpful in model composition. These voice-leading distinctions provide three more cadence categories to complement PAC, IAC, and HC: the *simple cadence*, the *compound cadence*, and the *double cadence*.

A *simple cadence* occurs when the dominant harmonic function is articulated by a single chord—either a triad or a seventh chord. The simple cadence can be used in a PAC, IAC, or HC construction, though the seventh-chord version is typically only found in authentic cadences.

A *compound cadence* occurs when the bass note *sol* of the cadential dominant is repeated, often with the second *sol* an octave lower than the first. The compound cadence comes in three specific forms.

The first type of compound cadence involves a 4–3 suspension—*do* to *ti*—over the *sol* bass of the dominant harmony. In a four-voice texture, the other two voices sustain a fifth above the bass and an octave above the bass. The *thoroughbass* figure is typically the abbreviated 4–3, which stands for 8/5/4–8/5/3 in four voices. The 4–3 suspension can occur over the cadential dominant of a PAC, IAC, or HC.

The second type of compound cadence adds a *mi/me* to *re* voice (6–5) to the above 4–3 suspension. In a four-voice texture, the bass is doubled. The typical thoroughbass figure is 6/4–5/3, leading to the common name for this progression, the *cadential six-four*. The complete figure is 8/6/4–8/5/3.  The cadential six-four can occur over the cadential dominant of a PAC, IAC, or HC.

The last type of compound cadence is a special case of the cadential six-four, where the fourth voice introduces a seventh over the second dominant chord, rather than simply doubling the bass for both chords. This compound cadence type requires four voices and complete thoroughbass figures of 8/6/4–7/5/3. This figure rarely occurs over the dominant of a half cadence and is instead reserved primarily for authentic cadences.

A *double cadence* is a four-stage pattern over the cadential dominant used almost exclusively in perfect authentic cadences. Though it had expired from common use by the time of Mozart and Haydn, it was a staple for earlier *galant* composers and *Classical* treatises on composition and accompaniment. The four-stage pattern over the dominant is 5/3–6/4–5/4–5/3. In four voices, the bass is also doubled, or a seventh can be applied to any *chord of the fifth* (i.e., not the 6/4).

## Voice-leading in strict keyboard style

In strict melodic keyboard style, always end an idealized phrase with a perfect authentic cadence (PAC). Approach the melody's final *do* by step whenever possible, from *re* or *ti*, preferably from *re*. When using compound or double cadences, use the orientation of upper voices shown in the above figures (transposed to the appropriate key, of course).

In *basso continuo* style, the top voice can end with any member of the tonic triad. As much as possible, use the voices provided in the figures above, but invert them (move the tenor line to the top, making the melody and alto the alto and tenor, for example). Simply make sure that if *ti* occurs in the top voice before the final tonic chord, it resolves its tendency up to *do*.

In either case, pay special attention to the cadential six-four version of the compound cadence. Despite forming a consonant triad with the bass, both the sixth and the fourth of the first chord act like suspensions, and therefore *must resolve down by step* and be prepared smoothly (by common tones or steps). This is true no matter which part is in the melody, alto, or tenor.
